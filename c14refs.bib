	Abstractnote = {In the 1960s, thermonulcear bomb test released significant pulses of radioactive carbon 14 into the atmosphere. This major perturbation allowed scientist to study the dynamics of the global carbon cycle by measuring and observing rates isotopic exchange. The Radiological Dating Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute to Technology performed carbon 14 measurements in atmospheric carbon dioxide from 1962 until 1993 at a network of ground stations in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These measurements were supplemented during 1965 with high- altitude samples collected using aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. The resulting database, coupled with other carbon 14 measurements, broad spatial coverage of sampling, consistency of sampling method, and the change in carbon 14 calculation results corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay. This database replaces previous versions published by the authors and the Radiological Dating Laboratory.},

	Abstract = {The prototype mini carbon dating system (MICADAS) at ETH Zurich has been in routine operation for almost 2 yr. Because of its simple and compact layout, setting up a radiocarbon measurement is fast and the system runs very reliably over days or even weeks without retuning. The stability of the instrument is responsible for the good performance in highest-precision measurements where results of single samples can be reproduced within less than 2â€°. The measurements are described and the performance of MICADAS is demonstrated on measured data.},

@article{Rossana1995,
	Abstract = {We examine the effects of temporal aggregation on the estimated time series properties of economic data. Theory predicts that temporal aggregation loses information about the underlying data processes. We find those losses to be substantial. Monthly and quarterly data are governed by complex time series processes with much low-frequency cyclical variation, whereas annual data are governed by extremely simple processes with virtually no cyclical variation. Cycles of much more than a year's duration in the monthly data disappear when the data are aggregated to annual observations. Moreover, the aggregated data show more long-run persistence than the underlying disaggregated data.},

We discuss how, for instance, a quarterly model can be used to predict one quarter ahead even if only annual data are available, and we compare the variance of the prediction error in this case with the variance if quarterly observations were indeed available. Results on the expected information gain are presented for a number of ARIMA models including models that describe the seasonally adjusted gross national product (GNP) series in the Netherlands. Disaggregation from annual to quarterly GNP data has reduced the variance of short-run forecast errors considerably, but further disaggregation from quarterly to monthly data is found to hardly improve the accuracy of monthly forecasts.},
